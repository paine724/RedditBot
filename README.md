# RedditBot
A redditbot that comments positive things on the subreddit xxketo.
This project was inspired by this post:http://pythonforengineers.com/build-a-reddit-bot-part-1/
I modified the project slightly to use a predefined string array, a different subreddit and different search constraints.

Project used python, praw, random and reddit api.
